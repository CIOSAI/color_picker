# Why Use This Tool

So many websites for "color generation" or "palette", but I just want a little color picker web app. Because Coolors f^#%ing started to put a bunch of ads in the page, you could just click them off before and now they want you to "upgrade to premium", you can upgrade me to a premium customer by removing those ads.

This color picker tool is made for people who are already familiar with colors, so no auto generated palette shouldn't be much of an issue.

# How to Use

*This tool NOT meant to be used with mobile or tablet, you experience f\*ckeries, please turn to other tools made by (I assume) smarter folks :)*
