# Why Use This Tool

So many websites for "color generation" or "palette", but I just want a little color picker web app. Because Coolors f^#%ing started to put a bunch of ads in the page, you could just click them off before and now they want you to "upgrade to premium", you can upgrade me to a premium customer by removing those ads.

This color picker tool is made for people who are already familiar with colors, so no auto generated palette shouldn't be much of an issue.

# How to Use

*This tool NOT meant to be used with mobile or tablet, you experience f\*ckeries, please turn to other tools made by smarter (I assume) folks :)*

Here is where all your colors sit, I plan to allow user to switch the order but no idea how to (I'm using react ts if you know how please help me)
Add new colors by clicking the plus button, or duplicate one by dropping a color onto it.

### Trashcan

Drag the color onto it to delete it.

### JS array

Click on the hex color text to make the drop down picker expand, the wheel is for hue, the square for saturation and value, click anywhere outside to close it.
